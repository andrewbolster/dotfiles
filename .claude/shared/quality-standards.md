# Quality Standards & Best Practices

## Data Verification Hierarchy (CRITICAL)
**Never violate this hierarchy for any data-driven content:**

1. **Direct tool outputs** (manage.py script, database queries, verified tool results)
2. **Specific citations** from dated documents with exact quoted metrics
3. **Explicit placeholders** with clear instructions for data gathering
4. **NEVER**: Estimated, assumed, interpolated, or "representative" data

## Timeline Validation (Mandatory)
- **Always verify which time period** you're writing about
- **Cross-check document dates** against content timeframe
- **When uncertain about timing, ask first** rather than assuming

## Link Requirements for Strong Claims
- Major project launches → Teams announcements, Confluence pages
- Published documents → Direct links to white papers, documentation
- Technical issues → JIRA ticket numbers (DS-935, CR-19716 format)
- Team discussions → Teams thread links
- External resources → Full URLs with context

## Voice & Style Guidelines

### Authenticity Markers
- **Technical asides** and informal explanations in parentheses
- **Honest assessment** of both successes and realistic challenges
- **Collaborative celebration** - always highlight specific team member contributions
- **Personal touches** that show personality over corporate-speak
- **Conciseness over explanation** - prefer direct statements
- **Technical precision** - specific system names, version numbers, exact details

### Tone Patterns
- **Understated determination** - persistence despite setbacks
- **Dry humor** about technical challenges and bureaucracy
- **Objective reporting** - facts over superlatives
- **Respectful correction** when accuracy requires disagreement

## Failure Mode Handling

### When Uncertain
- **Ask clarifying questions first** rather than making assumptions
- **Document what you don't know** instead of fabricating
- **Provide alternative approaches** when primary methods fail
- **Escalate appropriately** - know when to involve humans

### Quality Validation Checklist
□ All metrics sourced from verified data or explicit placeholders
□ Timeline/period alignment confirmed
□ Team member contributions specifically attributed
□ Realistic challenges included alongside successes
□ Links provided for major claims and announcements
□ Authentic voice preserved throughout
□ Appropriate structure for content type

## Tool Usage Protocol
- **Attempt direct execution** when you have access
- **Create intelligent placeholders** with exact command syntax when tools unavailable
- **Never simulate or fabricate** tool output formats
- **Document tool failures** and provide alternative data gathering instructions

## Content Standards

### Structure Requirements
- **Clear hierarchy** - main sections with logical sub-divisions
- **Consistent formatting** - follow established patterns for the content type
- **Actionable items** - include next steps and clear outcomes
- **Proper attribution** - credit all contributors and sources

### Technical Accuracy
- **Verify before stating** - check facts against available sources
- **Specify versions** - include exact version numbers and system names
- **Document assumptions** - make clear what is confirmed vs assumed
- **Provide context** - explain technical decisions and trade-offs
